- ## **Prerequisites**

- If you do not already have a **GitHub** account, you will need to create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)

- ## **Recommendations**

- Use an existing **GitHub** account if you have one. **GitHub** is more likely to block a new account as spam.

- Configure [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your GitHub account to reduce the chances of your account being marked as spam.

- ### Run the following Commands in CloudShell

```
curl -LO raw.githubusercontent.com/Titash-shil/Google-Kubernetes-Engine-Pipeline-using-Cloud-Build-GSP1077/refs/heads/main/qwiklab_explorers_gsp1077.sh
